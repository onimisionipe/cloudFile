CloudFile - Share files in more better, simple and secure way. Free and Open.
This Project is currently under development and would love contribution from the open source community.
This project was built on LAMP stack using my own MVC framework.
The controllers are stores in a folder called 'controller', like wise the model and views.
This project simply is a layer on operating system filesystem that allows users to create account, manage their files and most importantly share files. Users don't need to worry about file permission etc.

Current Development Stage:
The file sharing and download module is yet to be implemented. This components are still in development and would be implemented when they are done.

Audience:
Anybody hoping to set up a simple file sharing for small to medium community.

Before Install:
Please make sure you chmod 777 the base user direectory - 'userfile' as new user directory is derived from here.
Thank you.
